//Write an application that inputs three integers from the
//user and displays the sum, average, product, smallest and largest of the numbers. Use the techniques
//shown in Fig. 2.15. [Note: The calculation of the average in this exercise should result in an integer
//representation of the average. So, if the sum of the values is 7, the average should be 2, not
//2.3333â€¦.]
